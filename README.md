*Industrial robotic using Vrep robot simulation*

Unlike most human workers, industrial robots are content to do the same job over and over, for days and years on end. Not only that, robots do the job the same way every time, helping manufacturers increase production output and improve product quality and consistency, in this simulation we use Kuka LBR_iiwa_14_R820 robot arm wirh Conveyorbelt in Virtual Robot Experimental Platform(Vrep coppeliasim).
